# project-gallery
This site hosts the projects I have worked on for my application submission to Fonders and Coders. First I created 5 section tags and nested image and h2 elements. Then I uploaded placeholder images. After I used CSS flexbox to line the sections along the 'main' axis. I also used if statements in JavaScript to toggle the description. Finally, I styled the page changing the font, background colour and removed the top margin of the h2 element.

Edit: after putting in some text, I realised the text overflowed so I set the maximum width of the paragraph element equal to the images.
